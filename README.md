# ServiceNetwork

This little project is about Graph Algorithms written in Java. The program is executed by the file 'ServiceNetwork' which contains the main function. The directed cyclic Graph is read through a textfile called testGraph.txt following a certain format. There are three Graph Algorithms implemented:
1. The weigts are summed up from A startnode to B.
2. The number of possible paths from the A to B with a max number of hops or exact number of hops.
3. The shortest path from A to B.
For testing play around with the main function. Enjoy!
